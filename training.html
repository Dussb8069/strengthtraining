        <h1>INTRODUCTION TO <br> STRENGTH TRAINING</h1>
        <h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
        <p>Strength sports can be described as high weight and/or intensity movements. Pushing your body's hypertrophy
            with very little reps or movements. The ability of a muscle to apply force and overcome resistance or the
            amount of force a muscle can exert.</p>

        <h2>HYPERTROPHY</h2>
        <p>The term hypertrophy is thrown around the lifting community and generally in fitness. Hypertrophy is not the
            burning feeling when lifting, the feeling of exhaustion, or just maxing your weights. Hypertrophy is the
            increase and growth of muscles but more specifically, is the tearing of muscle fibers when exercising (more
            commonly when lifting till failure). Hypertrophy takes place after the workout when your muscles are torn and
            healing themselves in a stronger state. So, get excited when you feel sore in the morning.</p>

        <h2>MUSCULAR ENDURANCE VS MUSCULAR STRENGTH</h2>
        <p>There is a distinct difference between muscular strength, muscular endurance, and cardiovascular endurance.
            Lifting is categorized under muscular strength training because it is slow-paced, high volume,
            strength-based training.</p>

        <h3>MUSCULAR ENDURANCE</h3>
        <p>Muscular endurance is the action of training for higher and faster reps with low weight (some cases no
            weight). It is simultaneously working your heart and your muscles.</p>

        <p><strong>Sport:</strong> basketball, Pilates, soccer, sprint training, cross-fit, dry land training.</p>
        <p><strong>Exercise:</strong> body weight exercises, squats, burpees, box jumps, sprints, hurdles, HIT
            workouts.</p>

        <h3>MUSCULAR STRENGTH</h3>
        <p>Muscular strength is more focused on lifting heavier, larger muscle mass, and slow-paced but high-volume
            weight.</p>

        <p><strong>Sport:</strong> Strongman, powerlifting, weightlifting</p>
        <p><strong>Exercise:</strong> machine exercises, squats, deadlifts, benching</p>
