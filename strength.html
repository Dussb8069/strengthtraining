        <h1>CONDIDERING <br>STRENGTH SPORTS? </h1>
        <p>Strength sports are competitive activities that emphasize strength, power, and sometimes endurance. Athletes
             in strength sports focus on developing maximal strength and power in various movements. Here are some popular
              strength sports:</p>

    <section>
        <h2>POWERLIFTING</h2>
        <p>Powerlifting consists of three main lifts:
            <br>Squat: Athletes perform a squat with a barbell loaded on their shoulders, aiming to squat down until their thighs are parallel to the ground or lower.
            <br>Bench Press: Competitors lie on a bench and lift a barbell off a rack, lowering it to their chest and then pressing it back up to full arm extension.
            <br>Deadlift: Athletes lift a loaded barbell from the ground to a standing position, emphasizing hip, back, and leg strength.
            Powerlifting competitions test an athlete's one-repetition maximum (1RM) in each of these lifts. Competitors are divided by gender, age, and weight class.</p>
            
        <h2>CROSSFIT</h2>
         <p>CrossFit is a high-intensity fitness program that incorporates elements from various sports 
            and exercises, including weightlifting, gymnastics, and cardiovascular training. While not a 
            traditional strength sport, CrossFit competitions often include heavy lifting and strength-based workouts.
             Athletes compete in a variety of workouts that are scored based on time, repetitions, or rounds.
            These strength sports cater to individuals with different goals, whether it's lifting maximal weights 
            in powerlifting, showcasing power and speed in Olympic weightlifting, demonstrating overall strength and endurance
            in strongman, sculpting the body in bodybuilding, or embracing a diverse fitness regimen in CrossFit. Each sport requires dedication,
             training specificity, and often adherence to weight classes or physique standards for competition.</p>

        <h2>BODYBUILDING</h2>
        <p> While not strictly a strength sport in the same sense as powerlifting or strongman, 
            bodybuilding focuses on sculpting and developing the physique through resistance 
            training and diet. Competitors aim to develop muscle size, symmetry, and definition. 
            Bodybuilding competitions are judged on the overall appearance of muscle size, symmetry, 
            and conditioning.</p>

        <h2>OLYMPIC LIFTING</h2>
        <p>Olympic weightlifting involves two lifts:
            <BR>Snatch: The lifter lifts the barbell from the ground to overhead in one continuous motion.
            <BR>Clean and Jerk: This lift is performed in two parts. First, the lifter brings the barbell from the ground to the shoulders (the clean). Then, they push or jerk the barbell overhead to a locked-out position.
            <BR>Unlike powerlifting, where competitors aim for maximal weight in one lift, Olympic weightlifting combines speed, strength, and technique. Competitors are also divided by weight class.</p>

       
        <h2>STRONGMAN</h2>
        <p> Strongman:
            Strongman competitions test a wide range of strength and endurance skills. Athletes compete in various
            events that can include:
            <BR>Atlas Stones: Lifting heavy, round stones onto platforms.
            <BR>Tire Flips: Flipping heavy tires over a set distance.
            <BR>Farmer's Walk: Carrying heavy weights in each hand over a set distance.
             <BR>Log Press: Lifting a heavy log overhead for reps or weight.
             <BR>Truck Pull: Pulling a heavy vehicle with a rope or harness.

            Strongman competitions are known for their variety and often require athletes to be well-rounded in their 
            strength abilities. Events can vary widely between competitions..</p>
