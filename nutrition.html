        <h4>NUTRITION BEHIND<br>STRENGTH TRAINING</h4>
        <p2>Nutrition is vital for building strength and muscle as it provides
            essential proteins, carbs, and fats for muscle repair and growth. 
            These nutrients fuel workouts, support hormone production, and ensure 
            optimal bodily functions. Without proper nutrition, the body lacks resources 
            for muscle development, hindering strength gains and performance.</p2>
